			<p class="commentFromPoster">The Keystone XL pipeline is an important source of oil for the United States. Canada produces &#34ethical oil.&#34 We don&#39t have to fight wars to get it like the oil from Iraq or Libya, and we don&#39t have to buy it from oppressive monarchical regimes like Saudi Arabia. If we want an secure, ethical, source of oil we should build the Keystone XL.</p>

			<p class="commentFromPoster">Don&#39t build it! Global warming is the problem. Building this pipeline will make the problem worse. The Keystone XL will make it easier for Americans to get cheap oil and this will encourage more people to use more gas - making the problem worse. Also, the source of the oil is the Alberta oil sands - the most unsustainable oil extraction process on earth. If you care about the environment you will vote no.</p>
